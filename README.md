# Binary System and Logic Gates

## Description
This project explores how binary systems and logic gates form the fundamental basis of computer functionality. The project delves into how computers process text and images by converting them into binary code, where each letter or color is represented by a specific binary value.

Two Java programs were developed to demonstrate this concept: one for converting text to binary and another for converting images to binary by breaking them down into pixels and transforming each color according to its RGB value into binary data.

The project is highly expandable, allowing for the analysis of various abstraction layers within computer systems.

## Code and Execution
The project code is available on GitHub, showcasing the transformation process from images and text to binary, providing a clear demonstration of how computers process and understand these data types.

- To understand how the image-to-binary conversion works, the code is located in the `ProyectoOrganizacionIMAGEN` folder.
- For text-to-binary conversion, the code is in the `ProyectoOrganizacionTexto` folder.

Additional documents are included to further expand understanding of the processes involved.
