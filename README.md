# Binary System and Logic Gates

## Description
This project combines investigative learning with hands-on code development to explore and demonstrate how computers understand images and text through binary systems and logic gates.

Through in-depth research, the project examines how binary numbers and logic gates such as AND, OR, and XOR are fundamental to the processing and interpretation of data within a computer.

To bring these concepts to life, two Java programs were developed:
- **Text to Binary Converter:** Converts text into binary code, showcasing how each character is represented as a binary value.
- **Image to Binary Converter:** Breaks down images into pixels and converts each color into binary using its RGB values, providing a clear view of how computers process and store visual information.

This hands-on approach offers a tangible understanding of how computers interpret and manage visual and textual data, making the abstract concepts of binary and logic gates more accessible.

The project is expansive, providing insights into the various layers of abstraction that constitute computer operations.

## Code and Execution
The project code is available on GitHub, complete with examples that illustrate the conversion processes from images and text to binary. This code serves as a practical demonstration of the theoretical concepts discussed.

- **Image to Binary Conversion:** The code can be found in the `ProyectoOrganizacionIMAGEN` folder, where you can see how images are processed pixel by pixel.
- **Text to Binary Conversion:** The code is located in the `ProyectoOrganizacionTexto` folder, demonstrating the conversion of textual data into binary format.

## Additional Resources
For a deeper dive into the processes and concepts, additional documents are included in the GitHub repository. These resources offer a comprehensive look at the role of binary systems and logic gates in computer operations, enhancing the theoretical and practical understanding of these fundamental topics.
